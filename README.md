# mc-modular-shop
Made for the Zenysis server, this is a shop datapack that can easily be set up and put to use. It is also incredibly easy to move around inside the sell-signs inside the game world with just a kill nearby armor stands command ("/kill @e[type=armor_stand,distance=..3]") and placing the appropriate spawn egg at the new location. Made for 1.17+ but possible to use in older versions until maybe 1.12.x although not tested.

To install this in your minecraft world or server place the folder named "datapacks" into your world save file. On singleplayer the default file path would look something like: "C:\Users\{Your User Name}\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\saves\{World Name}" where {Your User Name} is replaced by your username and {World Name} by your world name.
In servers, the world may be right in the root directly, and probably named "world". Just put the "datapack" folder in there and type "/reload" ingame (same for single and multiplayer).
Once that has been completed, type "/function shop:first-time-setup" without the "" and place a command block running "/function shop:loop" on a fast redstone clock (or repeating command block if your server/world can handle it) or just put that command in your "tick.json" file (if your server/world can handle it).
